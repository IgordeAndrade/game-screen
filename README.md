 This repository contains our final project from the CS50â€™s Introduction to Computer Science course.

 This project is part of a feature that we will make at the company we work for, which consists of a feature that will upload videos to our database and, in real time, will make these videos available on a dedicated page, where other users will be able to view the videos. through a list sorted by time.
